    <h1>SKILL</h1>
    <pre>
My name is Piyush Raj. I am a motivated and curious student who is always interested in learning new technical skills. 
In today’s digital world, computer skills are very important.
 I have started building my knowledge in programming and web development.

I have learned the C programming language. 
Which helped me understand the basics of programming . 
Variables, data types, loops, functions, and logical thinking. 
C language improved my problem-solving ability and strengthened my programming foundation.

Along with C, I have also learned HTML and CSS. 
HTML helps me create the structure of a web page, while CSS is used to design and style the website. 
Using HTML and CSS, I can build simple and attractive web pages. 
These skills increased my interest in web development.

I have basic knowledge of JavaScript, which makes web pages interactive and dynamic. 
JavaScript helps in adding functionality such as buttons, alerts, and simple logic to websites. 
Learning JavaScript has helped me understand how websites work internally.

I always try to practice my skills regularly and improve them step by step.
 I believe that continuous learning . 
 Hard work will help me become a successful software or web developer in the future.
