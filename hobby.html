    <h1>HOBBY</h1>
    <pre>
Hobby is an activity that we enjoy doing in our free time.
 It helps us relax our mind and stay happy.
  Everyone has a hobby, and my favorite hobbies are playing cricket and listening to songs.

Cricket is my most loved hobby. 
I enjoy playing cricket with my friends in the playground.
 It keeps me physically fit and active.
  Playing cricket teaches me teamwork, discipline, and sportsmanship.
  It also helps me improve my concentration and decision-making skills.
   Whenever I play cricket, I feel energetic and refreshed.

Another hobby of mine is listening to songs. Music gives me peace and happiness. 
I like listening to different types of songs, especially motivational and soft songs.
 Music helps me reduce stress and improves my mood. I often listen to songs during my free time or while studying.

Both my hobbies help me maintain a balance between physical and mental health.
 Playing cricket keeps my body strong, and listening to songs keeps my mind calm.
  I believe hobbies play an important role in our life and make us feel positive and confident.
